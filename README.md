Tracking Knight Squire Relationships and Lineages for the SCA

## What is this for?

I hope to track the knight-squire relationships throughout the SCA known world.

### How this all started (Once upon a time ...)

A few years ago Carl Chipman (Duke Jean Paul de Sens) created a document where he was tracking the knight - squire relationships of the people he knew. you can see it [here](http://chivalry.ansteorra.org/new/knm.pl). I thought it was pretty cool and intersting to see who trained whom. It also used to tell you alot about what type of fight you would get from the person. Trainers and students all have tendencies.

A year or 2 ago i was on the Known World Chivalry Facebook group and found out about this little [gem](http://www.whitebelt.com/CHIVPROJECT/). This is the Order of Precedence for the Order of Chivalry for the SCA. This data is maintained by Viscount Edward Zifran of Gendy, KSCA, OL, OP, ETC, secrectly referred to as 114-K103-60.

So i sat there for a while and thought ... h'm. Wouldn't it be cool to track the knights and squires along with all the data that is found in the OP. Things like date elevated, kingdom elevated, what is my overall society chiv number.  That would be cool to see.

I also wanted to give everyone the ability to contribute. Give everyone the ability to update the data and say "Hey ... soandso is my squire". Instead of creating a bunch of code, webpages, databases and crap ... why dont we just track with updates using GitHub. Then anyone can add a pull request to update the data. Or at the very least post a bug saying hey ... the data on here is wrong please update it. Thats what GitHub is great at.

Anyone who wants to contribute add a pull request or post a bug.

Thank you,
